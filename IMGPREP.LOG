                        "True Color" display option on 8 & 4 bit displays.   

D. Ison         09-28   Updated PREV.C to support Truevision's silly RGB 
                        order problem.  Uses #ifdef TARGA to flip B <--> R.   

D. Ison         10-01   Fixed a bug in PAINT.C that caused a UAE when OPR
                        was abandoned.  (Cursor handle).

--(Seybold Show Beta RC 1.0 10-01-90)--------------------------

D. Ison         10-04   Fixed a bug with error-distributed dither on 1 row 
                        per strip images.  Put a test in FILTERS.C for this 
                        condition.

D. Ison         10-04   Fixed a bug in IMGPREP.C that caused a UAE when the  
                        gamma dialog was activated immediately after an 
                        abandoned paint.

D. Ison         10-04   Put the confirm exit message on the IDM_EXIT case.

D. Ison         10-04   Added an "Exit Windows" selection on the system menu.


--(Imageprep 3.1 Beta RC 2.0 10-08-90)--------------------------


D. Ison         10-08   Changed OIC so it uses the Resource String Table.  
                        This required defining a new structure to hold all
                        the info to use the Prometer and passing a pointer
                        to this structure into OIC.  (OICMETER)

D. Ison         10-09   Took out the "Exit Windows" command.               

D. Ison         10-09   Added a new "OPR Setup" dialog to specify the number
                        of colors to reduce to.  This now works when OPR +
                        NONE is selected.

D. Ison         10-10   Took out remaining text strings and replaced with
                        Resource file LoadString's.  (SAVE.C OPEN.C)

D. Ison         10-10   Fix a bug with the error-dist dither export in VGA.
                        The problem was with the exported images - they looked
                        (really) bad.   FILTERS.C EXPORT.C QUANTIZE.C

D. Mize         10-10   Added resetting of gamma and color correction tables
                        to CREATE of DISPLAY.C

D. Mize         10-10   Modified test to allow OPR color selection for dither
                        cases and reprocess image when number of colors is
                        changed in IMGPREP.C.

D. Ison         10-11   Added FlushEugene() to IMGPREP.C

D. Mize         10-12   Put in BALANCE.DLL. (IMGPREP.C)  Color Balance tool.


--(Imageprep 3.1 Beta RC 3.0 10-12-90)--------------------------

D. Ison         10-12   Added message WM_SHOWIMAGE to IMGPREP.C.  This was
                        to give Eugene a chance to unload itself w/o floating
                        memory problems.

D. Ison         10-12   Added command line parameter capability to IMGPREP.C
                        to allow specifying an image to open.          
                        Syntax:  win imgprep <options> <filename.ext>

D. Mize         10-16   Restored WM_SYSCOLORCHANGE messages that were mistakenly
                        deleted to tell other apps that system colors have 
                        been changed. (IMGPREP.C)

D. Ison         10-18   Added TIF monochrome read.  Also changed all HANDLE 
                        references involving access to DOS file handles to int.


--(Imageprep 3.1 Beta RC 4.0 10-19-90)--------------------------


D. Ison         10-22   Fixed a minor bug in PROMETER.DLL having to do with 
                        the progress meter window being left on the screen
                        in certain circumstances.

D. Ison         10-22   Optimized the PCX RdConvertData function a bit 
                        (PCXRCD.C).  Now it runs about 100% faster.

D. Ison         10-22   Took care of the LoadString problem for 2-byte 
                        languages (Kanji and the like) by making ALL
                        LoadString references use 256-byte buffers.
                        (Now all strings in the resource file in ImagePrep
                        can be up to 256 bytes long).



--(Imageprep 3.1 Beta RC 5.0 10-24-90)--------------------------


D. Ison         10-24   Took care of various "cleanup" stuff like text  
                        message to prometer.  
 
D. Ison         10-24   Added an OIC results dialog that comes up after 
                        OIC compression is finished, showing the file
                        sizes and compression ratio.   OICINFO.C

D. Ison         10-25   Fixed a problem with keyboard operation.  Main
                        menu could not be accessed when image was 
                        displayed.  Removed a SetFocus () from PAINT.C
 
D. Ison         10-25   Complete re-compile and link with actual released
                        Windows SDK.
 
D. Mize         10-26   IMGPREP.C in WM_CLOSE LocalUnlock(hStringBuf) caused
                        lock count to go negative by unlocking all the time
                        when lock only occurred if image active.        

D. Ison         11-06   Changed IMGPREP.C to fix the scrollbar range problem.

D. Ison         11-06   Changed PCXRDH.C to test for .PCX files with < 4 
                        bits per pixel.

D. Ison         11-06   Changed OPRSETUP.C to correct the "up-down"
                        condition in the OPR number colors setup dialog.

D. Ison         11-08   Fixed the "Mystery Dot" black spot probem that was
                        in REDUCE.C  (OPR Bug)

D. Ison         11-08   Chenged IMGPREP.C to gray out .PCX and .GIF screen
                        captures when running 24 bit display.

D. Ison         11-08   Changed TIFRDH.C to only look at the LOWORD of the
                        compression field.  Bones brought in some images that
                        someone wrote out in a bit unusual fashion.

D. Ison         11-15   Changed IMGPREP.C to change the way the scrollbars 
                        work.  They now try to use as much space in the main 
                        window as possible, instead of trying to scale the
                        display window.

D. Ison         11-20   Changed a couple of things in SETUP.C to fix some  
                        cosmetic details (Error Distributed dither.)  Changed
                        INFO.C to look prettier.  Changed "Color Dither" menu
                        to read Linear, Floyd-Steinberg, Modified Stucki"
                        Had a problem in TIFRDH.C with the test for 8 bit
                        special case tiffs.  Removed the test.

D. Ison         11-26   Changed the color dither menu back to "Burkes".

D. Ison         11-26   Fixed SQUASH.C bug that did not delete the output file
                        after a cancel from the OICSETUP dialog.

D. Ison         11-26   Fixed the Monochrome problem.  This problem was    
                        universal.  Any conversion from MONO to MONO would
                        generate the problem, not just large images. Changed
                        EXPORT.C

D. Ison         11-26   Fixed the problem with canceling from OPR in VGA mode.
                        Bug was in EXPORT.C.

D. Ison         11-26   There were a couple of stray problems with MONO files
                        in VGA mode, mostly involving the file read/write
                        modules.  These have been changed, and the bugs should
                        now be corrected.

D. Ison         11-28   Fixed a problem in IPUTILS.C involving border widths 
                        in the scrollbars.

--(Imageprep 3.1 Beta RC 6.0 10-24-90)--------------------------

D. Mize         12-04   Modifications to REDUCE.C to improve color reduction.
                        Allows for full 24-bit color space whenever possible.
                        Corrects problems with Color cell creation and determination.
                        Multiple methods for palette determination: default changed
                        to mean average rather than older median-cut (in certain
                        instances math may overflow) if this shows a problem, we
                        need to revert to less effective median-cut. Several
                        minor optimizations performed to compensate for added
                        processing time resulting from corrections to color
                        reduction.
                        
D. Mize         12-05   Changed default reduction back to straight median-cut
                        to avoid popularity problems for low number of reduction
                        colors.

D. Mize         12-05   Added Serial Number fields to ABOUT box (IMGPREP.RC)
                
D. Mize         12-05   Turned off scan if image is active
        
D. Mize         12-07   Optimized code for reduction (REDUCE.C REDUCE.H) uses
                        Color Cells for dithering, integer multiplies, new
                        mechanism for determining color cell distances, etc.
        


--(Imageprep 3.1 Release)---

D. Ison         12-17   Fixed yet another bug found in the CPI monochrome 
                        save.  Saving from scanned (1 bit) images to 8 bit
                        monochrome images messed up for certain images.
                        Changed CPIIH.C

                            overhauling the entire open mechanism in the app.
                            (Major workover).  This also affected tools.dll
                            Application now distinguishes between a user 
                            and a temp image which it deletes.
