
List of Items Still Pending for ImagePrep 4.0 Release
=====================================================

As of 05/28/91


Metafile Clipboard Copy


Integration of print (Print now exists in a prototype app)


Metafile Import - Does not affect state matrix.


Metafile Export - Modifies state matrix.  However, first phase has already
                  been done in anticipation of (Dennis) putting it in.  
                  But Dennis has been longer on print than expected.


Targa RLE Export - Modifies state matrix.  Note this includes M8, 16, 24, 
                   32 RLE exports.  Recent work on interface has taken 
                   priority over this.

  
Interface        - Implementation of "Processing Specs" dialog.
                   This dialog is intended to emulate the old
                   "Setup Processing" dialog plus support some
                   things that heretofore have only been available
                   as menu selections.
